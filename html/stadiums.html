                    <h3>Wembley Stadium</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wembley Stadium is, without doubt, the most iconic stadium in world football. Reopened in 2007,
                        the new Wembley was built on the site of the previous 1923 Wembley Stadium. Famous as one of the
                        most electric atmospheres in world football, the new design has encompassed everything that was
                        great about the original stadium and has added to that further.

                    <h3>Camp Nou (Barcelona, Spain)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Camp Nou is Europe's largest football stadium and is home to one of the great football
                        teams. Barcelona's motto “mes que un club” (more than a club) is iconic throughout the
                        footballing world, and their stadium is a huge part of everything Barcelona stands for. It truly
                        is a special club—so much so that they even have a detailed history of their stadium.

                    <h3>Santiago Bernabeu (Madrid)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Notable fixtures: 1957, 1969 and 1980 European Cup finals, 2010 Champions League final, 1982
                        World Cup final. The Santiago Bernabeu is home to one of Europe's most successful club. With
                        nine European titles to their name, Real Madrid's place in the upper echelons of world football
                        is secure, and there could be no more fitting venue for such a club to play. Originally opened
                        in 1947, the Santiago Bernabeu has since been renovated twice—in 1982 and 2001—in order to match
                        the ambitions of the Galacticos.

                    <p>
                        Old Trafford's tenants split opinion. You either love them or you hate them. But irrespective of
                        your slant, there's no hiding away from the fact that “The Theatre of Dreams” is a truly
                        magnificent venue. Opened in 1910, the home of the Red Devils now seats over 75,000 fans—after
                        its 2006 renovation—and is England's largest club stadium.

                    <p>
                        Notable fixtures: 1950 and 2014 World Cup finals, 2016 Olympic Games football final. The
                        Maracana is one of the most notable stadiums in world football, situated in one of the most
                        beautiful cities throughout the world. The stadium hosted the 1950 decisive World Cup
                        group-stage match (there was no final that year) between Brazil and Uruguay that saw a
                        staggering capacity of 199,854.

                    <p>
                        It is the only stadium across the Europe that is able to change colours
                        to reflect which of the two teams are playing—red for Bayern and blue for 1860 Munich. The
                        stadium has been a huge hit with both sets of fans thanks to the fans being closer to the
                        pitch—something that caused an issue at the previous site, the Olympiastadion, which had a
                        running track around the pitch that made for a rather poor atmosphere.

                        Notable fixtures: 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals. Mexico City's Estadio Azteca is renowned for
                        its huge capacity and electric atmosphere when full, but it will go down in history as the only
                        stadium to host two World Cup finals. Unfortunately for England fans, it is also the venue for
                        Diego Maradona's infamous “Hand of God” goal.

                        Notable fixtures: 2014 Europa League final. Although it's by far the newest stadium on the list
                        and has therefore not had the chance to secure a spot near the top, the Juventus Stadium still
                        sits pretty high because of its incredible atmosphere and wonderful design.
