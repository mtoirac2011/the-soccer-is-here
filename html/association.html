            <h2>Association football</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Association football</strong>, more commonly known as simply football or soccer (a shortening
                of the word "association"), is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11
                players. It is
                played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the
                world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each
                end. The object of the game is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into
                the opposing goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game.
            </p>

                Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm
                (27–28 in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams each compete to get the ball into
                the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. Players are not
                allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the
                penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other
                part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the
                game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals either a draw is declared or the
                game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. Each team is
                led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to
                represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA;
                French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and
                women every four years. The FIFA World Cup has taken place every four years since 1930 with the
                exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190–200
                national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a
                place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams
                competing over a four-week period. It is the most prestigious football tournament in the world as
                well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding the Olympic Games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most prestigious competition in club football is the UEFA Champions League which attracts an
                extensive television audience throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent
                years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[6] The top five European leagues are the
                Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France).
                Attracting most of the world's best players, each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600
                million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion.

                Football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide
                since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally
                codified in England by The Football Association.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules of association football were codified in England by FA in 1863 and the name association
                football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time,
                specifically rugby football. The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in
                the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe". The Online Etymology
                Dictionary states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863". The
                term soccer comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er"
                appended to it. The word soccer (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889
                in the earlier form of socca.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called "football" in the United
                Kingdom and mainly "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in countries where other codes of
                football are prevalent (Australia, Ireland, Wales, South Africa and New Zealand) may use either term,
                although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal
                name.
